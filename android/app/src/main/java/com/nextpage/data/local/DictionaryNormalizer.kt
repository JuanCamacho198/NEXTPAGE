/**
 * Shared normalization contract (REQ-DSI-004), byte-identical to the Rust and TypeScript
 * implementations: trim, lowercase, NFD decompose, strip U+0300-U+036F.
 *
 * Two rules this object must not "improve" away:
 * - Punctuation is preserved (`Abyss,` -> `abyss,`). Stripping surrounding punctuation belongs to
 *   the selection tokenizer, which runs before normalization.
 * - `lowercase()` is the locale-independent overload. A locale-sensitive call would produce a
 *   different key on a Turkish device and break the shared vectors.
