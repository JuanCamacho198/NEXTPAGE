 * Pure, JVM-testable decision gate for the one-time "Connect Google Drive?"
 * prompt shown after a successful book import. No Android dependency — every
 * input is passed in, so this can be unit-tested without Compose or a device.
 *
 * Decision (spec `drive-import-connect`): show the prompt only when ALL hold —
 * the import succeeded, Drive is NOT yet authorized, the user is signed in with
 * Google, and this account has not previously declined. Accepting persists
 * nothing here: Drive becoming authorized gates future prompts, and a later
 * Settings disconnect MAY re-offer (the decline marker is cleared on a
 * successful authorization — see the NavHost wiring).
