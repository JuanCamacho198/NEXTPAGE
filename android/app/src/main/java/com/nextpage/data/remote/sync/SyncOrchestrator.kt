/**
 * Top-level sync lifecycle handle for the three per-domain syncers
 * (Drive cold-backup, Supabase catalog, Supabase progress).
 *
 * PR-2 of sync-layer-split adds this interface; consumers are NOT yet wired in
 * this PR — `AuthViewModel.triggerSyncForSession` / `onLogout` migrate in PR-3.
 * Existing per-domain handles (`syncService`, `supabaseProgressSync`,
 * `supabaseBookCatalogSync`) stay reachable from `AppContainer` so domain-shaped
 * entry points (`pullAllHighlights`, `resumeForBook`, `getDownloadableBooks`,
 * `downloadRemoteBook`) keep working unchanged.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - [start] runs Drive first (non-fatal), then Catalog, then Progress — each
 *   in its own try/catch. Partial failure does NOT abort the rest.
 * - [stop] fans out to every per-domain `stop()` (added to Drive in PR-2).
 *   Idempotent; the second call is a no-op.
 * - [state] emits the aggregate [SyncState] union; transitions are reduced
 *   from per-domain + session-gate signals via a pure function
 *   ([SyncOrchestratorImpl.reduce]) so the rules are table-testable.
 * - [pendingCount] sums the per-domain pending counts (single shared outbox
 *   DAO table; sum collapses to the table total).
