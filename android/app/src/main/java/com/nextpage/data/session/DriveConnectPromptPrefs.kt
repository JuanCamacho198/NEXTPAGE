/**
 * Per-account persistence for the one-time Drive connect prompt decision.
 *
 * Only the DECLINE is persisted, keyed to the Google account that made it:
 * accepting leaves the prompt gated by Drive's authorized state (nothing to
 * store), and switching accounts gets a fresh offer because the marker is
 * compared against the current user's id. [clearDeclined] resets the marker
 * so a later import MAY re-offer (spec: "MAY re-appear once Drive is disabled
 * in Settings").
 *
 * Mirrors the [ReaderPreferences] SharedPreferences pattern — plain
 * `getSharedPreferences`, no encryption needed (a per-account boolean marker,
 * not a secret).
