/**
 * Navigation options applied when a bottom-navigation tab is selected.
 *
 * The Inicio (Home) tab is special-cased: tapping it must always collapse the
 * back stack to `[home]` from any other tab. To do that we pop up to the Home
 * route (non-inclusive), launch single-top, and deliberately do NOT use
 * [restoreState]/[saveState] — restoring the previous tab's saved sub-stack
 * re-instantiates a stale stack, and popping to the graph's
 * `startDestinationId` is a no-op when the start destination is "auth"
 * (absent from the stack), which is the root cause of the stuck bottom nav.
 *
 * Every other tab keeps the classic bottom-nav behavior: [restoreState] +
 * [saveState] around a non-inclusive [popUpToRoute] so each tab preserves its
 * own sub-stack while the stack still collapses on an Inicio tap.
 *
 * @property popUpToRoute Route to pop up to (non-inclusive) before navigating.
 * @property popUpToInclusive Whether [popUpToRoute] itself is popped.
 * @property launchSingleTop Avoids duplicate entries when the target is already on top.
 * @property restoreState Restores the tab's previously saved state (Home never restores).
 * @property saveState Saves the state of the entries popped by [popUpToRoute].
