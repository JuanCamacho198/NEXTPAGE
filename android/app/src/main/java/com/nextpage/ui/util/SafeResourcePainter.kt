 * Compose's [painterResource] throws
 * `IllegalArgumentException("Only VectorDrawables and rasterized asset types are
 * supported ex. PNG, JPG, WEBP")` for `<shape>`, `<layer-list>`, `<selector>` and
 * adaptive-icon XMLs. That exception crashed the app on the main thread
 * (NEXTPAGE-ANDROID-2 / -6). This guard keeps the screen alive and records which
 * resource produced the bad asset so it can be fixed at the source.
 *
 * @param resId drawable resource id.
 * @param fallbackColor solid placeholder shown when the resource is unsupported.
 * @param source short caller label used to identify the bad asset in logs.
