/**
 * Pure decision gate for the one-time "Connect Google Drive?" pre-prompt.
 *
 * Direct port of Android's `DriveConnectPromptGate` (no platform imports —
 * every input is passed in, so this is unit-testable without Tauri or a
 * webview). One intentional difference from Android: the `importSucceeded`
 * parameter is gone. On desktop the gate is evaluated only when a
 * Drive-gated action (cloud download, cold-backup export/import) is actually
 * invoked while unauthorized, so the trigger is implied by the call itself.
 *
 * Decision: show the prompt only when ALL hold — Drive is NOT yet authorized,
 * the user is signed in with Google, and this account has not previously
 * declined. Accepting persists nothing here: Drive becoming authorized gates
 * future prompts, and a later Settings disconnect MAY re-offer (the decline
 * marker is cleared on successful authorization).
